This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebook for Kaggle Digit Recognizer challenge. Two different neural networks were used for this challenge.

main.ipynb uses only Dense layers with a one dimensional image input. The best result by this network is 0.97353.

main_cnn.ipynb uses a Convolutional Neural Network. By this purpose, one dimensional data is reshaped as image. The best result is 0.98975.

main.py contains two methods together.
